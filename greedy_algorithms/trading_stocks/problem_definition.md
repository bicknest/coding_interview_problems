#Problem Definition

You somehow have a magic trading time machine that lets you look back at a series of stock prices by day and make trades on them.
You would like to maximize the amount of money you make with this machine. Write an algorithm that takes in a timeseries of stock prices (Integer array, where values are the prices) and outputs the
maximum amount of money you could make in that time range, buying and selling stock. You have to make
at least one trade, unless there are less than two days of data. You cannot buy and sell on the same
day.

Input: Array of integers, where the integer is the price of the stock and the index is the "day" of the price.

Output: An integer that represents the maximum amount of money you could've made from buying and selling stock.
