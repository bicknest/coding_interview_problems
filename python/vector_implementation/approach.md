#Approach

Overwrite/write special methods for the Vector class, that the pyton interpreter will use and call when using operators such as +, abs, etc.
Special methods (also called dunder or magic methods) in python begin and end with two underscores.

For this vector class you will have to implement:

`__init__`
`__repr__`
`__abs__`
`__add__`
`__mul__`
