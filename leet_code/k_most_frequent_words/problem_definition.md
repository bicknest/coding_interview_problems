## Top K frequent words

Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted, by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

Example:

Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k=2
Output: ["i", "love"]
"i" and "love" are the two most frequent words. Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

Note:
you may assume k is always valid
all words are only lowercase
