## K closest points to Origin

We have a list of `points` on a plane. Find the `K` closest points to the origin (0, 0)

(Here the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance)

The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10)
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8)
