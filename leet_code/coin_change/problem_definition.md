## Coin Change

Given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.


Example 1:
coins = [1, 2, 5] amount = 11
ouptut = 3

Example 2:
coins = [2], amount = 3
output = -1

Example 3:
Input coins = [1], amount = 0
ouput = 0

Example 4:
input: coins = [1], amount = 1
output = 1

Example 5:
Input: coins = [1], amount = 2
output: 2
