## Partition Labels

A string s of lowercase english letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of the parts.


## Example
Input: s: "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9, 7, 8]
