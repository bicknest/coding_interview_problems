# Problem Definition

Everyone knows the simple recursive algorithm to generate the fibonacci series
But that algorithm is extremely inefficent and will overflow the call stack when called with larger numbers.

Write a solution that calculates the nth number in the fib series with an iterative/bottom up approach.
