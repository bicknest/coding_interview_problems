# Approach

Iterate over the range of numbers 1..N calculating and saving the fibonacci number at each step.
Use previous the previous calculations of fibonacci numbers stored, to calculate the new ones.

Will need an array of size n, and will run a loop n times, so both time and space complexity will be O(n)
